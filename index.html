    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to BiasChecker! Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome extension (<strong>BiasChecker</strong>).</p>
    <p>By installing or using BiasChecker, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use immediately.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>BiasChecker does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share personal data. Our extension operates locally within your browser and does not transmit any data externally.</p>
    <p>However, certain <strong>non-personal</strong> technical data may be processed for functionality, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Extension Activity:</strong> Information about the usage of features (e.g., number of times BiasChecker is used).</li>
        <li><strong>Error Logs:</strong> If an error occurs, we may receive anonymous diagnostic data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Since BiasChecker does not collect personally identifiable information, any usage data (if applicable) is only used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improve extension performance and functionality.</li>
        <li>Fix technical issues and bugs.</li>
        <li>Ensure compliance with Chrome Web Store policies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or share your data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>BiasChecker does not integrate with or rely on third-party services that collect personal data. However, the extension may interact with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Websites you visit (to analyze content for bias detection).</li>
        <li>Browser storage (to temporarily hold analysis results).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All data processing happens <strong>locally</strong> on your device and is not transmitted externally.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Security</h2>
    <p>Since BiasChecker does not collect or store personal information, there is no data retention policy needed. However, we take security seriously and ensure that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The extension does not access or manipulate sensitive data.</li>
        <li>No background tracking or unauthorized logging occurs.</li>
        <li>All code follows Chrome Web Store security guidelines.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>BiasChecker complies with privacy laws worldwide, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (USA)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB) (India)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Digital Privacy Act (DPA) (Canada)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Other applicable privacy laws based on user location</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are a resident of any country with data protection laws, you have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Know what data (if any) is collected.</li>
        <li>Request deletion of any personal data (BiasChecker does not store any).</li>
        <li>Contact us with any privacy-related concerns.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since BiasChecker does not collect personal data, these rights are inherently respected.</p>
